**Developing a Canvas 2D Engine to Improve JS Skills**

The aim of the training is to create interactive canvas elements built on the most independent internal components.
The project consists of two parts:
1) Core - a set of basic functions, types and objects
2) Theater - a set of components that implement the interactive component of the project.

Theater is a space for creating animated scenes for user interaction. It contains:
1) Animation models
2) Model extension plugins
3) Scene set
4) Entry point and scenes management

In the project, the main basic component of the application is named - actor. Scenes are intended for grouping actors according to common characteristics, as well as for managing them within the scenario set for the scene.
